# Assignment: CRUD API

## Description

Your task is to implement simple CRUD API using in-memory database underneath.

## Technical requirements

- Task can be implemented on Javascript or Typescript
- Only `nodemon`, `dotenv`, `cross-env`, `typescript`, `ts-node`, `eslint` and its plugins, `webpack-cli`, `webpack` and its plugins, `prettier`, `uuid`, `@types/*` as well as libraries used for testing are allowed

## Implementation details


7. There could be some tests for API (not less than **3** scenarios). Example of test scenario:
    1. Get all records with a `GET` `api/users` request (an empty array is expected)
    2. A new object is created by a `POST` `api/users` request (a response containing newly created record is expected)
    3. With a `GET` `api/user/{userId}` request, we try to get the created  record by its `id` (the created record is expected)
    4. We try to update the created record with a `PUT` `api/users/{userId}`request (a response is expected containing an updated object with the same `id`)
    5. With a `DELETE` `api/users/{userId}` request, we delete the created object by `id` (confirmation of successful deletion is expected)
    6. With a `GET` `api/users/{userId}` request, we are trying to get a deleted object by `id` (expected answer is that there is no such object)


8. There could be implemented horizontal scaling for application (there is a `npm` script `start:multi` that starts multiple instances of your application using the Node.js `Cluster` API (equal to the number of logical processor cores on the host machine) with a **load balancer** that distributes requests across them)
